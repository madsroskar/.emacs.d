#+TITLE: Mads' Doom Emacs setup
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: README

While working on figuring out my own doom emacs setup, figuring out how elisp works,
and at the same time trying to figure out a little bit of org-mode as I go, I figured
I might as well try to document things a bit as I go.

Who I am:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq user-full-name "Mads RÃ¸skar"
      user-mail-address "madshvero@gmail.com")

#+end_SRC

Trick I was taught by @davazp in order to be able to type my name in emacs as =M-o=
on a US International keyboard is caught by an emacs binding, as well as being
one of our [[yt:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488uJAQgmw][glorious scandinavian letters]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-x RET C-\ norwegian-keyboard RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+RESULTS:

* Theme / looks
For most applications I am able to, I've set Dracula as the theme, as
it looks nice, and has packages for a whole lot of applications

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)
#+END_SRC

For now, I keep my org directory in the standard =~/org/= directory,
but I'll keep the setting here still to make it easier to switch.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-directory "~/org/")
#+END_SRC

I tried having a transparent background for my frame, but it seemed
like macOS wasn't all that much into it
#+begin_src elisp
;;(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(95 . 95))
;;(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha . (95 . 95)))
#+end_src


#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . "#1d1f21"))

(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Hack Nerd Font" :size 16)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Hack Nerd Font" :size 35))
#+end_src

Trying to get Projectile to get projects from my default search path,
but with varying luck
#+begin_src elisp
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/code"))
#+end_src
* [[file:packages.org][Packages]]
