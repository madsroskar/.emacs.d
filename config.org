#+TITLE: Mads' Doom Emacs setup
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: README

While working on figuring out my own doom emacs setup, figuring out how elisp works,
and at the same time trying to figure out a little bit of org-mode as I go, I figured
I might as well try to document things a bit as I go.

Who I am:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq user-full-name "Mads Røskar"
      user-mail-address "banana@gmail.com")

#+end_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: madshvero@gmail.com

Trick I was taught by @davazp in order to be able to type my name in emacs as =M-o=
on a US International keyboard is caught by an emacs binding, as well as being
one of our [[yt:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488uJAQgmw][glorious scandinavian letters]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-x RET C-\ norwegian-keyboard RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+RESULTS:

* Theme / looks
For most applications I am able to, I've set Dracula as the theme, as
it looks nice, and has packages for a whole lot of applications

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)
#+END_SRC

For now, I keep my org directory in the standard =~/org/= directory,
but I'll keep the setting here still to make it easier to switch.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-directory "~/org/")
#+END_SRC

I tried having a transparent background for my frame, but it seemed
like macOS wasn't all that much into it
#+begin_src elisp
;;(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(95 . 95))
;;(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha . (95 . 95)))
#+end_src


#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(background-color . "#1d1f21"))

(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Hack Nerd Font" :size 16)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Hack Nerd Font" :size 35))
#+end_src

Trying to get Projectile to get projects from my default search path,
but with varying luck
#+begin_src elisp
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/code"))
#+end_src

Don't need to set the title for xterm, I'm not fussy
#+begin_src elisp
(after! xterm
  (setq xterm-set-window-title nil))
#+end_src

Show the time and battery status in the modeline
#+begin_src elisp
(display-time-mode 1)
(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))
  (display-battery-mode 1))
#+end_src


#+begin_src elisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/org"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(setq
    org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("⁖" "◉" "○" "✸" "✿")
)
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :config
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

For the following see [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/77][this link]]
#+begin_src elisp
(setq company-idle-delay 0.2
      company-minimum-prefix-length 3)
